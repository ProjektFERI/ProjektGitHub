  <h4>How to play</h4>
  <p>After you create an account, you are able to choose 15 players from the English Premier League to form your fantasy team. Your choices are limited by the starting budget,
      which is 350M and number of players by position: 2 goalkeepers, 5 defenders, 5 midfielders and 3 forwards. You choose your preffered formation and 11 players that form
      your starting XI while the other 4 form your substitutes bench. Keep in mind, after you choose your team, changes to it are limited. You are allowed to change your team
      at any time, that is make substitutions and formation changes.<br>
      After you choose your team, you are added to the global Fantasy League, along with other users. The point of the game are the matches between your and the other
      users' respective teams. You choose who you want to play against, but you are limited to 5 matches per day. Based on the result of a match, you are rewarded 3 points for a win,
      1 point for a draw, but you do not receive points for a loss. Your place in the league is determined by the points you collect during the league season - 10 days.
      At the end of the season, the users whose teams finish in the first three league positions receive awards:<br>
